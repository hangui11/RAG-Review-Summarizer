They note that it is extremely moisturizing, feels nice, and does not cause breakouts or irritation. There is no mention of greasiness, as all reviews emphasize that the product is non-irritating and well-tolerated on sensitive skin. \\n\\nProduct: All reviews refer to the same moisturizer. No distinction is made between different products.   \n",
